    <h3>Cybersecurity Analyst</h3>
        <p>The role of a cybersecurity analyst requires an in-depth knowledge of a business’s IT inner workings, offer improvement advice for protecting IT systems and data, and the ability to swiftly respond to an incident. These aspects are clearly important to a business, as indicated by the ‘Top Burning Glass Occupations’ document, ranking a cyber security analyst at number 13</p>
        
        <h4>General Skills</h4>
        <p>The general skills required in the role of cybersecurity analyst include roughly 95% of the top in-demand skills from February 208 Burning Glass data sheet, with the first 13 skills being required all in consecutive order.  This goes to show that the role of a cybersecurity analyst is very demanding indeed. The three specific skills that I would need to work on in order to be considered a suitable candidate would be presentation skills, meeting deadlines and management. Besides a technical education, it is these three factors that higher education aims to promote, specifically through group work, and I can say with certainty these skills are being developed.</p>
        <h4>Specific skills</h4>
        <p>There are several job-specific skills required for this position. Networking in particular is a well sought-after skill as most breaches within cybersecurity all come from heavily network reliant attacks. A strong understanding of networking and protection of the database on the network enables the analyst to correctly identify potential breaches and understand how to effectively eliminate the issue. This understanding of how data is accessed and stored on a database on the network is supported by the ‘Skills in Greatest Demand’ burning glass document, ranking SQL skills as number one.</p>
        <p>Along with network skills, a broad knowledge of different security issues and threats is crucial to do the job properly. With experience comes greater knowledge in this particular field and keeping up to date with the latest developments and is very important in order to respond in the most efficient way possible to breaches and threats. Understanding windows vulnerabilities will be crucial and is indicated at rank 4. Because Windows is not considered the most secure operating system, and because most data centers are built on Linux partly due to this fact, it will be important for a cybersecurity analyst to have a vast knowledge of this. It is clearly a desirable skill ranked number 13 from the same data-source.</p>
        <p>Incident response and handling skills are required for most analysts. This is the ability to work within formal incident detection and response processes defined by the organization using industry standard protocols and procedures. Using available programs or custom programs, a cybersecurity analyst will likely need skills in C#. This is desirable as indicated by its rank 12. Supporting this as well is .Net Programming ranked at 16, which is what C# runs on. Analysts would not be able to do an effective job if these specific skills were not honed, and it is these three skills that need to be acquired to be considered suitable for the role.</p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>My opinion of my ideal job has not changed. Most of the information from burning glass was familiar and it is a personal belief that cybersecurity is considered one the best fields to be working in at the moment, with increasing opportunities within a very interesting field becoming more apparent. It is hard to imagine not want to be involved in Cybersecurity.</p>
