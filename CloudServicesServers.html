  <h3>
    Cloud Services/Servers
  </h3>

    <h4>What is it and what does it do?</h4>
    <p>Cloud services is a technology that enables access to on-demand and configurable infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available through the internet.â€¯<br>  
    These services enable a multi-directional flow of data from front end clients through the internet to the providers' systems. Cloud services can be accessed with a multitude of computational devices such as a computer or phone, so long as they support an operating system and have internet access or a VPN.</p>
        
    <h4>What makes this technology state-of-the-art?</h4>
<p>This technology is state-of-the-art as it gives users the ability to perform computing tasks without having to have the resources on hand. This allows for a significantly cheaper functionality whilst also enabling the user to effectively save on costs as you only pay for what you need.</p>

        <h4>What can be done now?</h4>
        <p>There are a variety of tasks that can currently be achieved with cloud computing, such as 
            Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) & Platform as a Service (PaaS), Hybrid cloud and multi-cloud, Test and development, Big data analytics, Cloud storage, Disaster recovery and data backup with more and more uses coming into play with further technological development. </p>
            
        <h4>What is it likely to do soon and what developments will make this possible?</h4>
            <p>Increased storage capacity with increased storage writing speeds: <br>
                A constantly developing requirement as today's data generates in increasingly high volumes with more and more businesses and users adapting to the use of cloud services. Increase in demand will lead to an increase in supply from competing providers at cheaper prices. </p>

                <p>Modular software: <br>
                    General size of individual programs, along with their complexity, is increasing, this is true and can be seen across the board in the technological field. This will inevitably lead to the cloud having to employ advanced system thinking.  
                    This ties in with storage in how more modules are stored in different servers on different cloud services.</p>

                    <p>Increased security: <br>
                        A must have to prevent cyber-attacks, with increased traffic comes the need for increased security, in order to protect all the sensitive data. </p>

                        <p>Cloud gaming: <br>
                            Whilst already readily available for use with services such as Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Now and with Microsoft's upcoming xCloud, it is yet to really hit the mainstream market. With increasing technological advancements across all areas of fields directly corresponding with Cloud Gaming, its popularity and also functionality will also certainly rise. 
                            One of the biggest (if not the biggest) drawbacks of cloud gaming is the latency, but with increasing developments and enhancements of internet connectivity, speeds are only getting faster and latency is getting lower and lower. Cloud gaming also functions that normally in order to access cloud gaming, users only need a device such as a laptop/smartphone or even just a regular old laptop/PC with an internet connection without needing to have a beefy graphics card that currently can cost thousands of dollars for high-end gaming cards. These minimum requirements allow for a broader range of people the possibility to game using the cloud whilst saving their hard-earned money at the same time. </p>


<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
<p>Potential impact: <br>
    One of the most substantial impacts of cloud services that can be argued is its ability to save on costs for its users. Other potential impacts that can be expected are the opportunities for new services and increased competitiveness of IT services made available for both the public and private organisations.</p>

    <p>Potential changes (industry/home): <br>
        Changes that we could see being made to both the public and private organisations could be: <br>
        Decreased use of on-site servers and hardware, enabling businesses to essentially startup with less investment.  <br>
        Unlimited storage capacity by removing the limitations of having to have physical drives to store your data by instead saving data onto the cloud. <br>
        Universal access from a range of internet capable devices from anywhere with an internet connection.</p>


        <p>Who will be affected and how: <br>
            Cloud computing already affects all internet users every single day from things like communication software (Zoom, Skype, Messenging apps), Productivity software to Cloud storage and backups.</p>

            <p>Job/technology prospects: <br>
                Whilst still a relatively new field, there are already a plethora of job prospects for those interested in the field of cloud computing. Such prospects are Cloud security architect, cloud infrastructure engineer and cloud consultant just to name a few. With the ongoing evolution of cloud services, the number of prospects will only go up, although until a need for that role is discovered it could be anyone's guess as to what that might be.</p>

                <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
                <p>With the evolution of cloud services, a personal user such as myself may one day not have the need to own a physical computer anymore. I will be able to perform all of my desired and required computing tasks on the web which will allow me more freedom by removing the requirement of having to be stationary on my massive desk with my massive computer setup, allowing me the ability to work from anywhere I see fit.</p>

                <h4>What will be different?</h4>
                <p>Along with the requirement of having to own a physical computer and being confined to my desk no longer being mandatory, differences we are likely to see will be a continued growth of programs becoming based on the cloud instead of operating on local systems. This functionality will not only allow more ease of access but will also make the devices much faster by taking a load off the system and letting cloud services handle the bulk of the computational power instead. </p>

                <h4>How might this affect family member or freinds?</h4>
                <p>A way in which cloud services might affect my family is that it will enable my mother to communicate easier with her family that lives in a poorer third world country where for a sizeable portion of the population, technological devices we take for granted in Australia are scarce. Increased developments in cloud services resulting in it becoming more mainstream will enable my family to stay connected easier. </p>
