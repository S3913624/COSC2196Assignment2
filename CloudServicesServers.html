    <h4>What is it and what does it do?</h4>
    <p>Cloud services is a technology that enables access to on-demand and configurable infrastructure, platforms, or software that is hosted by third-party providers and is made available through the internet. These services enable a multi-directional flow of data from front end clients through the internet to the providers' systems. Cloud services can be accessed via a multitude of computational devices such as a computer or phone, so long as they support an operating system and have internet access or a VPN. (Redhat, n.d.)</p>
        
    <p>This technology is considered state-of-the-art as it gives users the ability to perform computing tasks without requiring any hardware resources, other than an interface. i.e., phone or computer. This allows for significantly cheaper functionality whilst also enabling the user to effectively save on costs as you only pay for what you need. </p>
    <p>Examples of use include hybrid cloud and multi-cloud, Test and development applications, data analytics, cloud storage, disaster recovery and data backup. There are a variety of tasks that can currently be achieved with cloud computing, and can be divided into three categories:</p>
<ul><li>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): Considered the most flexible as the user can essentially use the vendors hardware however they like. The user can install their own operating systems and applications, but the caveat is that the user is responsible for maintaining the data and operating system. AWS EC2 is a prime example.</li>
<li>Platform as a Service (PaaS): An option aimed towards developers building software applications. Because the platform is built and available, the user can focus on app development rather than managing software updates or security patches. It is less flexible than IaaS because it is not bare bones. The operating system and other background tasks are managed by the cloud provider. Google App Engine is one such service.</li>
<li>Software as a Service (SaaS): The least flexible of the three, SaaS is software made available over the internet. Programs don’t need to be installed on the users end and is great for scalability. Security and maintenance of the program is all taken care of by the provider. Microsoft Office 365 is a forerunner for business in terms of SaaS.</li></ul>
<p>Cloud computing is a constantly evolving technology, with more and more uses coming into play with further technological development. A prime illustration is increased storage capacity along with increased storage writing speeds. This is considered a constantly developing requirement as today's data generates in increasingly high volumes with more and more businesses and users adapting to the use of cloud services. Increase in demand will lead to an increase in supply from competing providers at cheaper prices.</p>
<p>The demand for increased storage is often driven by the increased size and complexity of individual programs across the board in the technological field. This will inevitably lead to the cloud having to employ advanced system thinking. This ties in with storage in how more modules are stored in different servers on different cloud services.</p>
<p>Cloud Gaming for instance, whilst already readily available for use with services such as Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Now and with Microsoft's upcoming xCloud, it is yet to really hit the mainstream market. With increasing technological advancements across all areas of fields directly corresponding with cloud gaming, its popularity and also functionality will also certainly rise.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback of cloud gaming is the latency, but with increasing developments and enhancements of internet connectivity, speeds are only getting faster, and latency is getting lower. Cloud gaming also functions that normally in order to access cloud gaming, users only need a device such as a laptop/smartphone or even just a regular old laptop/PC with an internet connection without needing to have a beefy graphics card that currently can cost thousands of dollars for high-end gaming cards. These minimum requirements allow for a broader range of people the possibility to game using the cloud whilst saving their hard-earned money at the same time.</p>

<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
<p>One of the most substantial impacts of cloud services that can be argued is its ability to save on costs for its users given its scalability and subscription-based models. Other potential impacts that can be expected are the opportunities for new services and increased competitiveness of IT services made available for not only business and industry, but also private organisations and for personal use. Illustrations include:</p>
<ul><li>Decreased use of on-site servers and hardware, enabling businesses to essentially start-up with less investment. </li>
  <li>Unlimited storage capacity by removing the limitations of having to have physical drives to store your data by instead saving data onto the cloud.</li>
  <li>Universal access from a range of internet capable devices from anywhere with an internet connection.</li>
  </ul>
<p>There are drawbacks to cloud computing however. It is argued that job loss due to outsourcing of IT requirements to the cloud, internal staffing to manage the infrastructure will become much less important. In spite of this concern and whilst still a relatively new field, there are already a plethora of job prospects for those interested in the field of cloud computing. Such prospects are Cloud security architect, cloud infrastructure engineer and cloud consultant just to name a few. With the ongoing evolution of cloud services, the number of prospects will only increase, although until a need for that role is discovered it could be anyone's guess as to what that specific role might look like.</p>

<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
<p>With the evolution of cloud services, a personal user may one day not have the need to own a physical computer anymore. One will be able to perform all of their computing tasks on the web which will allow more freedom by removing the requirement of having to be stationary on a massive desk with a massive computer setup, allowing the ability to work from anywhere. </p>
<p>In this way, differences we are likely to see will be a continued growth of programs becoming based on the cloud instead of operating on local systems. This functionality will not only allow more ease of access but will also make the devices much faster by taking a load off the system and letting cloud services handle the bulk of the computational power instead. </p>
<p>This decrease in computational power can be seen to afford families much better communication. Families will be able to speak to each other across the globe, perhaps to users in a third world country where for a sizeable portion of the population, technological devices we take for granted in Australia are scarce. Increased developments in cloud services resulting in it becoming more mainstream will enable families to stay connected easier. Truly a commendable reason to embrace cloud computing as a whole.</p>
