  <h3>
    Network Engineer
  </h3>

  <p>Based on the “Top Burning Glass Occupations” document, a network engineer ranks 15th out of the 25 listed for the year 2017-2018. It is interesting to note however that a network support officer ranks 12th and a network/system administrator ranks 4th. It is clear that networks are important to an organisation and can be argued that through further skill development, certification and experience, a network engineer is certainly not an occupation to be scoffed at. This is backed up by the “Top Job Titles” burning glass document which ranks a Network Engineer as number 9 out of 25.</p>
  <h4>General Skills</h4>
  <p>The advertisement indicates that excellent customer service skills will be an integral part of the role. As per the “Skills in Greatest Demand” burning glass document this ranks 14th out of 25. Additionally, ranked 8th, building relationships is a highly regarded skillset and is a requirement of a network engineer. Strictly speaking there do not appear to be any general skills not already acquired, and this is backed up by a decade leading a sales team in a technical and competitive industry.</p>
  <h4>Specific skills</h4>
  <p>The role is a technical service role, supporting data, voice, and security systems across the organisation. Technical support skills are particularly desired in IT, ranked 11th from the burning glass statistics. Additionally, despite what the advertisement says, a comprehensive knowledge of Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems will be required. Windows is the most widely used operating system and is easily recognisable by most users, so it is important to be able to support them, as demonstrated by its number 4 rank. At number 13, Linux is also important as it is deployed worldwide across most data centres given its portability, stability, security, and support. It is these three skills in particular that require development to be considered suitable for the role. Although not impossible to obtain through study and certification which are both requirements of the role anyway, the most practical way to obtain and develop these skills would be through exposure and experience.
  <h4>Reflection</h4>
  <p>It is encouraging to see statistically that the role is well sought after, and is particularly encouraging to see multiple, more advanced avenues of the role listed very highly. The specific skills do not appear too out-of-reach, and acquiring the general skills is a non-issue. In this way, the opinion of the role is reinforced. It is indeed a more ‘entry level’ role, but one that is well sought after with plenty of opportunity.</p>
