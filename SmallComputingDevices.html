  <h3>
    Small Computing Devices (Single-board computers)
  </h3>

  <h4>What is it, and what does it do?</h4>
  <p>Single-board computers such as Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, and Makey Makeys all fit different purposes and after over three decades of progress in computing have become the state-of-the-art in embedded hardware. They provide affordable, compact, and easy-to-use platforms which are found in industrial and scientific applications, as well as in education and software development.</p>
  <p>Embedded computing used to be a lot more expensive and relegated to applications like kiosks, digital signage, and high-end machinery. Modern single-board computers are beginning to take over and become more prevalent both as affordable embedded systems, and as educational tools that give students easier access to hardware. Hobbyists have used single-board computers to enable the development of their own machine controllers, robotics components, smart-home systems, and environmental sensor systems.</p>

  <p>Some purposes that different single-board computers excel at include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Using boards like the Arduino for the control of electronics systems and sensors</li>
  <li>Using boards like the Nvidia Jetson or Coral Edge to accelerate development of machine learning applications</li>
  <li>Using boards like the Raspberry Pi or ODROID to develop embedded applications that run a full operating system and provide the capability for user interaction</li>
  <li>Using boards like the Makey Makey to educate people about hardware and software development</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Boards like the Makey Makey provide simple platforms to educate people about a concept. The Makey Makey is not as customizable or general purpose as an electronics control board and is aimed at teaching people about circuits and sensors. It provides an easy-to-use interface that allows the user to connect different things to the device and use them as inputs on a computer.</p>
  <p>Basic electronics control boards like the Arduino are flourishing in industrial markets, where they are beginning to find their place in machinery like 3D printers, CNC routers and more. They are also used to control lighting, collect data from sensors, and as devices to expand a hobbyist’s capabilities.</p>
  <p>Single board computers like the Raspberry Pi or ODROID are the next step up from an electronics control board and provide extra capabilities such as support for input devices and full operating systems, as well as having the ability to control electronics.</p>
  <p>Machine learning accelerators like Nvidia’s Jetson or Coral’s Edge platforms are less general purpose. They usually take the interfaces of a traditional single board computer and provide an extra piece of hardware highly specialized for development of scientific applications such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. This provides an affordable development platform for emerging technologies and allows students and hobbyists to utilize previously cost-prohibitive technologies.</p>
  <p>Progress in single-board computing relates directly to how we interact with technology in our world and as single-board computers become more powerful, so will our every-day use of computing. A single Raspberry Pi or ODROID unit is powerful enough to rival the performance of full-size desktop computers from a decade ago.</p>
  <p>In the future more students will have access to more advanced embedded computers. As platforms like Jetson or Edge become more powerful and affordable, more general-purpose uses will emerge that take advantage of technologies like machine learning. Expensive concepts like computer vision will be in reach of beginners that may not have afforded it previously and as regular embedded systems become more powerful, previously advanced devices like automated teller machines will become cheaper and more compact.</p>

  <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
  <p>The impact that single-board computers have on us is wide-ranging and reaches all of us. As embedded systems become cheaper to produce, jobs that previously required careful human supervision can be replaced. In an industrial setting this might improve production efficiency but reduce the number of jobs provided to people. In the home this can be viewed as a productivity revolution – as things like automated cleaning systems become more prevalent, the burden on us is reduced and we have more time to pursue our personal goals.</p>
  <p>Single-board computers also introduce the concept of clustered computing to the public by providing their platforms as singular modules, allowing average users to build small form factor and high-performance compute clusters specialized for things like web servers and scientific math. This is especially important for the web, where websites are beginning to run high speed requests and performance critical tasks on individual processing cores. Development of highly parallelized applications will become more commonplace, and more people will use compute clusters to develop and test their programs with scalability in mind.</p>
  <p>Older systems will become redundant as they are replaced by more compact and powerful systems and market exposure will change for industries like signage, where instead of using specialized hardware, they will have access to inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware.</p>
  <p>Students will be able to learn and apply previously expensive computing concepts from a younger age, as they will have general-purpose hardware suitable for applications like machine learning. This will enable them to start learning about development, and building projects for the future much younger and with many less requirements.</p>

  <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
  <p>The effects of single-board computing on the technical climate are seen everywhere. As an example of technological progress and reduction of scale - instead of having a large set-top box for the television, a family may have a dongle the size of a keychain that streams any content from a home or remote server to the family television. This can be considered particularly beneficial for the elderly or less technologically inclined family members, where they can just select a show to watch from the smartphones they are familiar with, instead of struggling with a complicated remote control. Another benefit that may affect an individual may be an overall reduction in electronic gadgets, or devices that traditionally could not be shared throughout the house easily. Instead of having a gaming console attached to a single television, single-board computers allow one to stream video games from a machine in another room.</p>
  <p>We are already seeing intuitive applications that remove technical debt and have improved usability. General purpose systems are becoming easier to specialize for different tasks, enabling developers to focus more on functionality and user experience than systems design and implementation. As we improve our techniques and introduce more advanced concepts like machine learning, we will also begin to see more advanced uses in the real world. Surveillance systems are already beginning to rely on machine learning for computer vision – advances in the embedded space will allow systems like these to be self-contained and bring them within reach of the average computer.</p>
  <p>Consumer experiences have also become more straightforward as kiosks become affordable to implement – supermarkets have self-checkouts, service centers have electronic ticketing systems, and parking lots have advanced to the point where we can just pay on our phones and never stop to fiddle with tickets.</p>
