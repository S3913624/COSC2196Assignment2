    Business Analyst - Cyber Security
  </h3>
  <p> Going off what has been represented in the industry data supplied by Burning Glass for top 25 job titles, there is not a clear category for: Business Analyst- Cyber Security. Given this job is very specific in nature it is understandable as to why it isn’t on this list supplied. However, based off the secondary document ‘Top Burning Glass Occupations’, a business analyst for cyber security is entitled: Cyber/Information Security Engineer/Analyst which ranks at 13th of the top Burning Glass occupations. </p> 
    <h4> General Skills</h4>
    <p> The main component, and top item listed for a business analyst, is previous experience working in the role. The number of years of experience expected is unfortunately not listed from the employer, although based on the experience requirement data from Burning Glass, the most highly sought-after experience time period is 3-5 years. It is reasonable to assume that the employer for a business analyst, at the least from this employer, would be expecting several of the top applicants to have experience within those year brackets. </p>   
    <p> Alongside this, while not listed from this employer according to Pratt & White (2019), the most important two generic skills for a business analyst are: </p>
   <ul>
    <li> Oral and written communication skills </li>
    <li> Interpersonal and consultative skills </li></ul>
    <p> These two key qualities are ranked extremely high by Burning Glass as some of the greatest skills in demand by employers. Communication skills are ranked as the number one skill sought after in the IT industry by employers. Communication skills are so highly regarded and in demand, it is almost three times higher than the second highest skill, problem solving. Interpersonal skills or working in a team is ranked as the 5th highest amongst the data.  </p>

    </p><br>
  
  <h4> Specific Skills </h4>
  <p> The employer’s advertisement describes IT awareness, business analysis and management skills being key skills required for their advertised position. </p>
  <p> IT awareness infers some knowledge regarding IT systems most predictably for the role of an analyst, knowledge about applications of Microsoft Windows. Knowledge of their programs and the applications of Windows is in top demand across a multitude of IT industries, given that the specific skill is ranked 4th among Burning Glass’s greatest specialised in demand skills. Any knowledge of Microsoft windows can also then be applied to other jobs if the need to do so arises.   </p>
  <p> Business analysis is ranked as the 9th in demand skill from employers. Business analysis also can be learned as a skill almost in perfect parallel with business management a skill ranked 2 places higher. Given the position is to fulfil a role in regard to identifying the impact of cyber security across a business a knowledge of business management could only be seen as a positive on a resume to a prospective employer.  </p>
  <p> Business management skills are in a much higher demand than analysing a business surprisingly from Burning Glass’s data with it being ranked at 5th out of 25.   </p>
  <p> Forgoing the specialisation into cyber security, business analysis is a comparatively new discipline in IT. There is currently a plethora of organisations that have begun running a small number of courses and certifications specific to business analyst. Gaining these required skills, if not already acquired, is not an arduous task.    </p>
 
    </p><br>
  
  <h4> Reflection </h4>
  <p> Upon introspection of the data supplied from Burning Glass and the analysis into what skills, both general and specialised, are coveted by other searching employers, it is reassuring to notice that if circumstances do arise and an applicant for a business analyst position does not succeed, the skills they possess would be welcomed into a great many number of other positions for a business analyst. Personally I feel my view on this position has not changed as a great many number of these skills can be applied to many other fields across the IT industry. The only loss of this act would be if a candidate is very much inflexible with what type of specialisation they wish to pursue. If they were set to be an analyst for cyber security it may be a little more difficult given that at the present time, as according to Burning Glass, roles for cyber security are not a high ‘in demand’ field just yet.  </p>
