  <h3>
    Cyber Security
  </h3>
    
  <br>
    
  <h4>
    What does it do?
  </h4>  
    <p> The term cyber security is the practise of defending various types of Information Technology (IT) from malicious attacks. Examples of IT that can be protected by cyber security include: computers, servers, mobile devices, networks and data. This state-of-the-art IT technology over the past few years the world have seen an increasing number of users worldwide in modern initiatives, this has added to the increased inundation of data, most of which is sensitive and confidential. Because of this Cyber security needs to continuously maintain modern and advanced techniques to combat threats to protect different aspects of IT.   </p>
    <p> There are many different types of cybersecurity and can be used in a variety of contexts in the present day, a few common categories that can be found are as follows.  </p>
  
    <ul>
    <li> <i> Network security: </i> the practise of securing a computer network from targeted attacks and/or opportunistic malware.  </li>
    <li> <i> Application security: </i> this is the focus on keeping both software and devices themselves safe from threats. An ill designed application could provide access to the data it is designed to protect.  </li>
    <li> <i> Information security: </i> defends the veracity and privacy of data, both while in storage and also while in transit.  </li>
    <li> <i> Operational security: </i> includes the processes and decision making for dealing with and guarding data assets.  </li>
    <li> <i> Disaster recovery and business continuity: </i> this is how an organisation responds to an incident with anything involving cyber security or events that cause the loss of operations or data. This may involve new policies being emplaced to avoid similar situations in the future.   </li>
    <li> <i> End-user education: </i> addresses the most unpredictable threat to cyber securities, people. Humans may unwittingly introduce a virus to a secure system by failing to follow appropriate security practises. Introducing people to education about the kinds of threats which can compromise a system is vital to the security of any organisation and system.  </li>
    </ul>  
    
    <p> Automation has become a keystone component of cyber security with the unprecedented rise of social media, the usage of computers -both for personal and business use- and the internet at large. Using artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and adaptability in areas of high-volume data can immensely improve cyber security particularly in three main categories.  </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li> <i> Threat detection: </i> AI platforms are able to analyse and recognise known threats much faster than a human can. With the use of machine thinking some cybersecurity AI systems are able to predict simple threats as well.  </li>
      <li> <i> Threat response: </i> Cyber security AI can automatically enact security protections in response to perceived threats it may be aware of.  </li>
      <li> <i> Human augmentation: </i> Human cyber security employees can be overloaded with the innumerable alerts and repetitive tasks. AI helps eliminate alert fatigue by automatically triaging low level alarms and automating larger data analysis and multiple repetitive tasks, thus in turn freeing the humans for more sophisticated tasks.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Given the fast-growing rate of cyber crimes worldwide it is no surprise cyber security as a whole is at the forefront of future IT technological advances in the next few years there is number of options that may be able to be accomplished. More and more of both our personal lives and professional lives are being conducted online than ever, particularly due to the COVID pandemic over the past 18 months. Identifying the absolute path to the future for cyber security, given its constant evolution it goes under regularly in response to the immense number of threats, no one can give a definite response as to what the next cyber security threat will be or where it will even come from. However, there are a number of components that cyber security professionals will find essential to combat the nature of future cyber-attacks.  </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <i> Artificial Intelligence:  </i> coming to fruition in the past number of years AI has been outstanding for performing tasks that consume valuable time for humans which can be spent addressing larger security concerns. Future developers of AI may intend to embed security AI into user interfaces to alert its users about risky websites or poorly chosen security behaviours. AI’s may also be used to create simulated cyber-attacks to help reveal weak points which can be fixed by cyber security professionals.  </li>
      <li> <i> Removal of legacy tech:  </i> many manufacturers find little reason and motivation to continually release updated security patches for outdated systems even when new vulnerabilities become common knowledge. Removing this older tech removes exploitable systems and opportunities for cyber-attacks.   </li>
      <li> <i> Development of trained cyber security talent:  </i> currently there is a shortage of employees with the applicable skills to maintain adequate protective measures worldwide. Companies have begun to invest and train up a number of employees to help avert any cyber-attacks. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <br>
    
    <h4>
      What is the likely impact?
    </h4>
    <p> The possibility of damage to job opportunities from the integration of AI into cyber security may be a factor a very long way down the track. Cyber security on a global scale is still in its infancy comparatively to other professions.   </p>
    <p> It is a possibility in the far future cyber security is wholly overlorded by AI completely making human cyber security consultants redundant. Though this possibility is unlikely it is a future that may occur, more than likely though, the relative “arms race” between both cyber attackers and cyber security people there is a chance that cyber security will need to constantly adapt and evolve to meet the challenges imposed on them by cyber attackers.   </p>
    <p> Currently, as previously stated, companies and industries are clamouring to get as many cyber security professionals employed as possible. Due to the recent rise of cyber attacks over the past decade it is an industry in which many businesses and companies are lacking strong support. Being a new frontier for employment there are many opportunities available in terms of jobs and new technology to be developed.    </p>
    <p> If AI is integrated thoroughly with enough machine learning it is possible that AI’s are able to counterattack the attackers possibly retrieving data regarding the attacker themselves. For this to occur however there would need to be great many legislative pieces enacted to ensure the data is taken for the right reasons. It is far more likely that for the foreseeable future cyber securities and cyber attackers will compete in an arms race to try and maintain an edge over the other. But eventually one will find a way to combat the new edge and the cycle will continue.   </p>
 
    <br>
    
    <h4>
      How will this likely affect you?
    </h4>
    <p> In day to day life this change within cybersecurity may not be noticeable at all, if both cyber attackers and defenders continue to fight against each other, whether with AI assistance or not, it is predicted that the number of attacks is due to increase over time and thus the number of strategies that will need to be emplaced to combat this will rise alongside it to meet it. It is a possibility that a company or organisation you work in may be the target of a successful attack which may lead to sensitive data being stolen. If the path involving AI being successfully integrated into user interfaces becomes a reality, we might see a reduction in the number of cyber attacks being brought about user error or lack of education.   </p>
