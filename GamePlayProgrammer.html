  <h3>
    Game Play Programmer
  </h3>

  <p>Burning Glass has not listed Game Play Programmer in their 'Top Job Titles’ document – however, the third position on their list is ‘.Net Developer’, which is a software development skill often possessed by Game Play Programmers. This helps us to infer that Game Play Programmers generally identify as Software Developers. According to the ‘Top Burning Glass Occupations’ document, ‘Software Developer / Engineer’ ranks in first place as the top Burning Glass occupation.</p>

  <h4>General Skills</h4>
  <p>The job listing has asked for strong communication skills, which is ranked first on Burning Glass’ ‘Skills in Greatest Demand (Baseline Skills)’ document. A Game Play Programmer must also be able to collaborate with their team and make compromises to provide the best possible solution. As it is important for developers to build a healthy relationship with their team and nurture collaboration, I would also include ‘Team Work / Collaboration’ which is ranked as fifth.</p>
  <p>The job listing also asks for strong programming skills in C#. This would include ‘Problem Solving’ which is third place on the ‘Skills in Greatest Demand (Baseline Skills)’ document, as well as ‘Troubleshooting’, which places sixth.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, the only skills without clear guidelines to acquire are related to teamwork and collaboration, which can be improved upon with further experience.</p>

  <h4>Specific Skills</h4>
  <p>The role involves supporting a team of developers and artists in implementing gameplay systems in code. Its listing asks for a strong background in programming with the C# language; in Burning Glass’ ‘Skills in Greatest Demand (Specialised Skills)’ document, ‘Microsoft C#’ places twelfth.</p>
  <p>Due to the technical duties of a software developer, it is also necessary that they have a strong background with the target operating system – in this case as it is a listing focused on Unreal Engine, most technical processes will require extensive experience with Microsoft Windows which places fourth on the ‘Skills in Greatest Demand (Specialised Skills)’ document. It is also important for the management of a project that a software developer is familiar with source control software like ‘Git’, which places 21st.</p>
  <p>Although Git and Microsoft Windows are not on the listing, they are essential technologies for any Game Play Programmer and other software developers alike. Certification for Microsoft Windows skills are easily acquired through vocational learning and form the basis for many beginner IT specialists. Git skills would be acquired through familiarity with working in a team environment and are supplemental to the software development aspect. Familiarity with C# can be earned by a programmer simply using the language and becoming more familiar with it. </p>

  <h4>Reflection</h4>
  <p>It is reassuring to see that although Game Play Programmer is a specialized job title for software developers, the skills required by the job are sought after by other software developers and IT specialists. Although software development is a more difficult skill to obtain, there is the opportunity to easily acquire the general IT skills required. These generalized skills would provide ample opportunities for an aspiring Game Play Programmer while they learn and improve upon their software development skills.</p>
