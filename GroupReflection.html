  <h1>
    Group Reflection
  </h1>

  <h4>Nick Parker</h4>
  <p>I believe the group performed admirably. Everyone pulled their weight, and the quality of work was better than expected. It was impressive how receptive to feedback everyone was. As we got more comfortable with each other over the weeks, I felt it was clear the dynamic was working well. It was this aspect that was most surprising.</p>
  <p>However, there were times when communication became a problem. There were instances where some members disappeared briefly, which was concerning given a history of dropouts from our original team. In this regard it is an area for improvement, but one that is being addressed through open and honest dialogue. I felt that each of us were understanding of the circumstances and annoyances, and I believe this dialogue worked well in managing potential conflict.</p>
  <p>If there was only one thing learnt from group work, it was how to break a complex project into clearly defined steps or sections. We may not have intentionally set out in this manner, but we certainly arrived at that point. Towards the end we kept saying to each other "after section x which I'm doing, all we have left is section y from you, and section z from him! Killing it!"</p>
  <p>Overall, I feel we did "kill it", and I can't wait to attack the next assignment with 404.</p>

  <h4>Shawn Mills</h4>
  <p>I believe group 404 has performed above average. Considering elements such as certain members ghosting without warning, and another member joining without prior communication, and next to no communication after the fact, I believe we have pulled together well.</p>
  <p>I believe that certain areas of improvement can include a focus on increased communication, especially when certain situations arise, forcing someone to not be able to be active for a moment to not leave the rest of the group wondering what has happened. </p>
  <p>It is also my belief that moving forward it would be marginally beneficial to also focus on completing things earlier on to save the last-minute rush where the entire team is working on the same thing at the same time, to avoid confusion (especially with the delay of GitHub pages updating) and also to just help with overall preparedness. We have learnt this the hard way and expect to apply this to future assignments, especially with GitHub commits.</p>
  <p>Aside from this, I am surprisingly happy with how well all the team members have performed and come together to complete this assignment. All members I believe have contributed their fair share considering everyone’s circumstances and I believe at the core we have formed an efficient team and I look forward to the next tasks for 404.</p>

  <h4>Perrin Wardle</h4>
  <p>Impressively, the general composition and even simply forming the group went well. We have all been able to make compromises, and discussions on the distribution of work have been very flexible. Although we had a few people drop out of the group initially, all the active members managed to make meaningful contributions and help redistribute the assigned workload.</p>
  <p>As a team our organizational skills could improve as we were not very familiar with tools like Microsoft Teams and GitHub. We have already demonstrated clear progress towards that goal, however. Improvement to the amount of contact between us – some people had not been aware of group activities until it was too late to contribute, possibly due to other circumstances. We also had some confusion about when members of the group were active.</p>
  <p>It was surprising at just how cooperative we all were – I had envisioned that a team full of strangers would be prone to conflict. We were quick to make compromises and were able to have thoughtful discussions about any complicated decisions we needed to make. </p>
  <p>I learned that although working in a group has a lot of commitments, it is made easier by having a team that looks out for each other. All of us have different commitments, and I don’t think we could have made it to the finish line if we weren’t altruistic.</p>

  <h4>Daniel Wilkinson</h4>
  <p>As a member of team 404 I honestly found myself very surprised and impressed with how well the group performed together. With scheduled meetings twice a week, where most members attended, (unless personal circumstances prohibited otherwise) I felt we maintained a strong finger on the pulse from start to finish. Having the team meetings before or just after the scheduled webinars helped maintain consistency which was only a benefit to coordination.</p>
  <p>Things to improve on for next time do not figure prominently into mind the only one item that comes to my mind is having specific dates or milestones of completed dates for specific items of the assignment. As said though, a very minor improvement considering the group stayed in contact well. </p>
  <p>As mentioned, a surprising impact of the assignment collaboration compared to previous group work involvement was that the members present at the group meetings all continued to contribute to the project as a whole.  </p>
  <p>One thing I can say I am coming away with from team 404 collaboration is that while there may always be certain individuals that are not contributing or communicating within any given group assignment, speaking and organising with the members that come through consistently is the crucial component for it to succeed which I feel we aced splendidly.</p>

  <h4>Mathew Phillips</h4>
  <p>Team 404 welcomed me into the group late, as my original group had disappeared, and I could not be gladder they did. The group ran very smoothly with clear and regular communication and meetings, and everyone was getting things done as needed.  </p>
  <p>I did get quite ill shortly after joining unfortunately, so my participation was not as high as I would have liked it to be, and in this manner, I intend to improve greatly for future assignments with the group. There were also some hiccups with other group members, one who had been an active participant but then fell off the planet when Sydney went into lockdown, and another who stealth joined the group and in no way provided anything of value. We discovered later that he hadn’t even started Assignment 1. </p>
  <p>I was surprised with the groups decision to go with Nick’s app idea over the game, but I think it shows the maturity of the group and the desire to succeed instead of attempting something a little out of our means due to our shared videogame interests.  </p>
  <p>I personally was dreading the group assignments from this course, but I’ve learned that with the right people they can be an engaging and enjoyable experience that I now look forward to instead.  </p>

  <h4>Group</h4>
  <p>Every single member of group 404 dreaded the thought of collaborative assignments. Every member had previously been involved in groups, either at work or school, where there was conflict, non-participation, a lack of direction, or all of the above. Every single member concluded however, without hesitation that 404 worked emphatically well together. Everyone was pleased with each other’s efforts. Everyone was mature enough to come to the table with any concerns, and felt comfortable enough with each other to both give and receive helpfully critical feedback on any given task. We all agree we could not have asked for a better group. </p>
  <p>All things considered, we each agreed that communication was sometimes an issue. To begin with we had several members who just disappeared without a trace. To compound this issue further we had an interloper. A member who was not invited, and did not helpfully contribute by any means at all. Finally, we had several participating members go AWOL briefly, which was concerning to the rest of the group given these prior issues. It became apparent that these particular members were simply unwell, and the issue was resolved. We all concluded however that notification would have benefited the group, to put everyone’s mind at ease. </p>
  <p>Not only did we learn how important communication was, we additionally learnt how important it was to stay on task and ensure that we were all committed to the deadlines proposed. Yes, because of illness this was difficult for some, but because others had complied, we were able to keep the overall assignment completely under control. Given the fact that almost all team members have full time jobs and various family commitments, there was no point at which any of us felt overwhelmed or behind and we were each extremely surprised by this. </p>
  <p>We were also surprised by our individual personal profile pages from assignment one. Each of us did not overly hold much regard to the results of the Myers-Briggs test, and for the most part dismissed them. As assignment 2 progressed, each of us noticed similarities between profile results and our colleagues that perhaps the individual may not have seen in themselves. It was clear that those that were outlined as organised and practical, were indeed organised and practical. Those that were altruistic and sensitive, were indeed so. Finding these similarities was surprising to a group that so casually dismissed the profile results as pseudo-science. </p>
  <p>Going forward we are excited to learn more about each other, and about the topics at hand. Each of us have skills another may not, and together we expect great things.</p>

  <h4>GitHub Commit Comment</h4>
  <p>The GitHub logs may not necessarily reflect an accurate portrayal of participation. Some worked very hard on the PDF report, others worked very hard on the website. Some worked hard uploading content of the PDF to the website, while others worked hard styling the website. Ultimately, we are all satisfied that we participated equally, and therefore the five members of 404 should be marked equally.</p>
