<h4>Investigation</h4>
<p>The group has concluded that we are all individuals and that the results of personality tests or learning profiles should not necessarily be considered the be-all and end-all for establishing a group in the first place. <br> 
Despite this, each and every one of us can agree with some aspects of our individual results, and applying these results to predicting the group dynamic is particularly interesting. <br> 
<br>
The most noticeable common denominator is that each of us appear to be hard-working and responsible in some form or another. <br> 
These are factors held in high regard when forming a group, as a group project will likely delay when individuals cannot take up the mantle to do things when things need doing. <br>
<br>
The group has some altruistic team members which will always benefit a group, but not necessarily the individual as they can become overloaded. <br> 
It will be important for our calmer, more rational or practical team members to take notice and help when they can so as to mitigate burnout. <br> 
More-so, by being too altruistic and taking on too much for the group, a project could potentially be delayed as there may not be enough hours in the day to complete the tasks required. <br>
<br>
There are several personalities that can be considered a source of potential conflict within the group. <br> 
According to the results there are some critical and dismissive personalities that can oppose others with more sensitive personalities. <br> 
Ultimately though the group feels this can be offset by our team member with the least common attributes to the group. <br> 
The principled, insightful, and passionate member of our team has potential to think outside the box and see things from another perspective. <br> 
They are predicted to stand up for each member of the team, and combined with being altruistic will work for the benefit of the team, not an individual. <br>
<br>
How prevalent a personality attribute is to our individual person is yet to be seen however. <br>
There is no clear indication of how severe a personality attribute is. i.e., exactly how hard-working or responsible is the individual? Exactly how critical and dismissive are we talking? <br> 
It is this aspect that a profile test fails to recognise that makes predicting a group dynamic accurately. <br> 
It is to be said however that we as a group are very interested to see how the dynamic evolves based on our predictions and pre-understanding of each other. <br></p>
