<h4>Investigation</h4>
<p>The group has concluded that we are all individuals and that the results of personality tests or learning profiles should not necessarily be considered the be-all and end-all for establishing a group in the first place.
Despite this, each and every one of us can agree with some aspects of our individual results, and applying these results to predicting the group dynamic is particularly interesting.</p>

<p>The most noticeable common denominator is that each of us appear to be hard-working and responsible in some form or another.
These are factors held in high regard when forming a group, as a group project will likely delay when individuals cannot take up the mantle to do things when things need doing.</p>

<p>The group has some altruistic team members which will always benefit a group, but not necessarily the individual as they can become overloaded.
It will be important for our calmer, more rational or practical team members to take notice and help when they can so as to mitigate burnout.
More-so, by being too altruistic and taking on too much for the group, a project could potentially be delayed as there may not be enough hours in the day to complete the tasks required.</p>

<p>There are several personalities that can be considered a source of potential conflict within the group.
According to the results there are some critical and dismissive personalities that can oppose others with more sensitive personalities.
Ultimately though the group feels this can be offset by our team member with the least common attributes to the group.
The principled, insightful, and passionate member of our team has potential to think outside the box and see things from another perspective.
They are predicted to stand up for each member of the team, and combined with being altruistic will work for the benefit of the team, not an individual. </p>

<p>How prevalent a personality attribute is to our individual person is yet to be seen however.
There is no clear indication of how severe a personality attribute is. i.e., exactly how hard-working or responsible is the individual? Exactly how critical and dismissive are we talking?
It is this aspect that a profile test fails to recognise that makes predicting a group dynamic accurately. 
It is to be said however that we as a group are very interested to see how the dynamic evolves based on our predictions and pre-understanding of each other. </p>
