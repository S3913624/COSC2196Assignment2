    <p style="color:blue">Nick Parker: Thanks so much for being with us today. I know it's a lot to ask, taking time from a busy IT professional such as yourself.</p>
    <p>Evan Byatt: Yes, it’s absolutely outrageous, I’ll be sending my bill!</p>
    <p style="color:blue">Hah! Send the invoice. I'll forward it on to RMIT. So, I guess the first question is, you've been in the industry basically since school? What's that going on? 14 years? Longer?</p>
    <p>Yeah, so I started working in IT in 2007. I was sort of working at the school that I graduated from, and it was also the year that I started university at UTS, which I then ended up graduating from with a Bachelor of Science in IT degree.</p>
    <p style="color:blue">Yeah, great, something I’m currently aspiring for! Excellent. So, who then do you currently work for, and what do they do for those who don't know?</p>
    <p>I work for a pretty large software company called Atlassian, who build business collaboration software. Originally focused on software development tooling, making developers more productive, the tooling has since evolved and it's now more focused on allowing any team to be more productive</p>
    <p style="color:blue">Are there any specific examples that we might recognize? </p>
    <p>Yeah, so we do a pretty famous issue tracker called JIRA. It's very commonly used by project managers who manage large scale projects. NASA used JIRA to land the rover on Mars. Cochlear, a company that make auditory implants too. As an idea, in order to build a cochlear implant, it’s quite a comprehensive process, very convoluted and I think there's a thousand different steps that they have to do in a certain order. Each construction is quite involved, and so they use JIRA to track the different states of that mini project. Another tool that we’re quite well known for is confluence. And that's more focussed on documentation. It's basically a wiki.</p>
    <p style="color:blue">Cool, that’s great. So, what is your current role there exactly, and what does it involve on a day-to-day sort of basis?</p>
    <p>My current title is senior software engineer. I moved into the anti-abuse team within the last year and so my job is to attempt to detect and mitigate deliberate misuse of Atlassian products. Because our products are primarily offered for free, in the cloud, for a small number of users (and then as the user base grows that's when you start paying), generally that does create opportunity for abuse. For example, people uploading undesirable content, malware. Potentially, not that we've observed it, but child exploitive material. There's the risk that people could upload terrorist material. Our team was actually founded in the wake of the Christchurch massacre, with the live stream that happened that was shared on Facebook. They wanted to mitigate the risk in the last year, of that being a problem on our platforms.</p>
    <p style="color:blue">Wow, OK, yeah, that's something really everyone should be considering these days, I guess.</p>
    <p>Yeah, it's pretty heavy. </p>
    <p style="color:blue">But you're not directly affected, or you don't have to directly view any of that content? </p>
    <p>No, we don't. We don't do that. We've written software that can automatically detect that sort of stuff. For example, with child exploitative material, there's a company in the UK called the Internet Watch Foundation. They collaborate with law enforcement worldwide, and whenever they seize child exploitative material, they take “fingerprints” of the files that they seized, basically produce an MD5 hash. And there's also something called photo ID, which is a little bit more robust in the sense that with a hash, if you change the file by just one pixel, that will change the hash, and so an easy way to get around that filtering would be to just modify the file. That maybe wouldn't even be visible to the software. So, the photo ID prevents that from being the case. But yeah, basically we have a list of known blacklisted content and we scan all files that are uploaded to our platform to see if the file that we've received is on that blacklist. We can then take steps to then report that user to the authorities, as well as quarantine the file and have like a whole chain of custody for reporting purposes as well as deactivate the user and remove the content from the Internet.</p>
    <p style="color:blue">Excellent, that's great. So, we sort of covered briefly how you started, what sort of steps got you to your current role? Being a senior at such a prestigious sort of company? I mean you started in school, you went to Uni, what exactly were the steps involved employment-wise?</p>
    <p>We’ll step back a little bit. I got a job at Trinity Grammar School where I graduated high school, simply because I studied it, similar to you. You know in year twelve it was IPT (Information Process and Technology). What a terrible subject.</p>
    <p style="color:blue">No comment…</p>
    <p>I worked at Trinity for a year. Absolutely hated it, but mind you that’s more of the culture of that department. I sort of had ambitions to study IT at Uni, which is why I ended up going to UTS. The degree that I enrolled in actually had a second component, so it was a Bachelor of Science in IT, as well as a Diploma of Professional Practice. What that professional practice diploma required was doing an industrial placement. So effectively, a minimum of nine months of work experience, paid work, at any IT company. And then I had to do a whole lot of self-reflection. Yeah, basically a few subjects that just made the Uni a bit more money. So, this is a bit of a laugh actually! I heard at Uni that there was a free lunch on Level 3, so myself and a couple of others said, “oh, you know, we'll go check that out. Go check out the free food.” We walked up and lo and behold, it was a recruitment activity hosted by people from Macquarie Telecom. I'd never heard of them and had no ambitions of working for them, but when we went into the room, sure enough all the food had already been eaten, which was a shame. But I stuck around just because I thought that leaving immediately would be a little bit rude. I stuck around to listen to what they had to say. I met one of the founder’s brother. Met my prospective manager. They did a hard sell to get your details to put you on their HR database. They actually repeatedly called me up. I thought it was a little bit much. Who are these guys, what the hell? They invited me to go and have a look at their data centre. I went to see the data centre, but I had no idea that it was recruitment activity again… So, I rocked up in pretty casual clothes and I felt a little bit underdressed when I saw that there were other people in suits. It ended up being that there was a job interview after the tour. I mean they totally lied to me, like they said that this is to check out what a data centre looks like, but in reality, there was an interview where I had to speak to a senior engineer, and one of the shift leaders, and he asked a lot of technical questions. So, I nailed that part and then they asked me back for a second interview.</p>
    <p style="color:blue">Are you aware at this point that it's a job interview process? </p>
    <p>At that point, I dressed appropriately. Suited up. I Had the second interview with the guy who ended up becoming my manager when I was hired as a graduate. So, I had the offer, and this was an opportunity to start immediately, and this was about 18 months into my degree. I just completed three semesters, so I was halfway. And then of course the industrial placement would normally happen after that, or just before the final year. So, I could start now or start in six months. I decided to start immediately. I didn't want to lose the opportunity and then before I knew it, I was full time, employed working at Macquarie Telecom as a graduate NOC engineer. That was a systems admin type role, basically network security engineers as well as sysadmins. This role was hands on, logging onto devices, responding to customer demand. Managing incidents when things broke. You're dealing with the project teams when things were not up to speed because we were the support team. 12 months after my graduate role they offered me a promotion, a fixed term contract for 12 months. I accepted that they gave me a decent pay rise and I’ve sort of been working full time ever since.</p>
    <p style="color:blue">Great alright. So, you had a few different roles in Macquarie Telecom?</p>
    <p> After the graduate role I was a NOC engineer in general, without the graduate title. 18 months after that I got the opportunity to be a shift leader, so one of the more senior NOC engineers where you're actually managing the shifts and the rostering. Because this was a shift work environment as well, when you’re shift leader, you didn't have to work shift work anymore, which was great. So, it's back to business hours of nine to five. Eventually after that I got promoted to a service assurance engineer. That was much more senior because you're no longer in the NOC. You no longer necessarily just doing support. There are a few things we did. We were the support escalation point. So, when the NOC engineers were unable to resolve the problem, occasionally you would need to act as an on-call resource, so they could call you anytime day or night to escalate the issue to you and hand it over to you, so that you can then fix it and leverage your expertise. We did a little bit of a quality assurance in terms of reviewing the presales, like review technical consultant engineers’ designs, to see whether they were right, to see whether they were technically feasible, whether it would actually work, whether it would be reliable, and if we could support it basically. We also acted as key hosting account engineers, so we were customer facing. When I was eventually moved into the federal government team I would fly down to Canberra every fortnight, go down to Melbourne, and meet clients and discussed the technical issues, and then come back to Sydney and fix them. So, network security operations type work. After about five and a half years at Macquarie Telecom there was an opportunity to work at Atlassian. One of my peers. He actually referred me to a job at Atlassian, a guy who was in the same team as me at Macquarie Telecom. To touch on what I did in my early days at Atlassian, we were managing the on-demand platform, so Atlassian cloud. It was still very much an infrastructure role. We would build the infrastructure in data centres in the US and everything from the bare metal installs of the operating system to the software that we run on top of it that helps us manage the platform, and things like the scripts that we used to monitor and provision integration with the billing system. All of those sorts of APIs our team managed, so it's very much like a full stack role. There's a whole lot of security focuses there as well. Eventually Atlassian redesigned our cloud platform, so they did away with on demand and they moved everything to AWS. Amazon is one of the big cloud providers. My team sort of split into two different teams with different focuses. I ended up working in the Kubernetes team. So, Kubernetes is a sort of container orchestration framework. That's sort of all the rage and has been for the last few years. I've worked in the kube team. We were running more than 100,000 containers per day. A lot of them were for CICD pipelines, so when software developers are building and testing their code, they want to run that in a consistent environment that can be run repeatedly over and over. We built out Kubernetes clusters to support that. So, one of Atlassian’s other products, Bitbucket pipelines, will integrate with Kubernetes, and when you run a build via pipelines, that in turn will execute a container on top of a Kubernetes cluster that we managed. The last little while I've been in the anti-abuse team as I outlined earlier, which is about detecting deliberate misuse of these platforms, and that's a much more software focused role, whereas all the other roles I've had have been very heavily focused on infrastructure. This is very much so, a software engineering role, so I'm writing code. The vast majority of my time. Now, having said that, the way Atlassian does manage infrastructure is through code. It’s sort of the generally preferred way to do it in the industry at the moment, but as they are software company you know, everything is code. That's sort of the preference.</p>
    <p style="color:blue">I can appreciate that, yeah. So, it sounds like you've had a hand in a whole range of different departments. What sort of departments then do you directly deal with being in the anti-abuse team?</p>
    <p>Yeah, so we generally deal with the teams that manage the products, that face the abuse. For example, one of our products is called Trello. It's a tool to track your tasks and build lists and things like that. You can think of it as a digital post it note app where each card would be the post it note. So, they had a spam problem where people were using Trello to send spam. We wrote an anti-spam service that takes a body of text and then can return a score about the probability that it is spam. Now, it's using a custom machine learning model that we built. Initially we integrated with a cloud vendor to do it, but we hired a contractor and did a whole lot of analysis and did the feature engineering and built our own model and we've actually found that more reliable than the cloud vendor version. So, it is integrated with Trello in that they send every single one of their card creation or board creation events through our API, and then we scan that for the likelihood of it being spam and then provide feedback. We make an event to an event bus which they can then consume later on. If we say that something is spam, the content will automatically be hidden from the Internet, so the privacy settings will be changed. If we identify that user is malicious, that could be based on them spamming other users on the platform, or inviting random people on the Internet to join their board or organization, that creates an event to say that that user is bad and then in that case the user will be deleted. So yeah, we've worked with Trello very closely to manage that sort of integration, make sure that everything is working properly. That the actual model doesn't drift and remains accurate.</p>
    <p style="color:blue">Yeah, excellent. What do you reckon takes up most of your time, or what do you find most challenging about working at Atlassian in the anti-abuse division?</p>
    <p>The most difficult thing is getting the data that we need. Basically, getting new products or tenants to integrate with our existing services. We've written the anti-spam service for Trello being one of many products. Being able to scan all of JIRA and Confluence, being the largest products, all events that are created there as well. You know there's other tools like OpsGenie and BitBucket that we would also like to integrate with. Getting new tenants on board with our platform is very challenging. Even getting the required data that we need is a challenge.</p>
    <p style="color:blue">So that being said who's responsible for interacting with those sorts of tenants and departments to get them on board?</p>
    <p>Generally, they would reach out. If they have some sort of abuse, they will generally reach out. If it’s significant enough, that they wasted enough time, they would ask for help. The company knows we have an anti-abuse team. The senior leaders know, if there were an outbreak in JIRA then someone would tell someone and then that person would probably suggest reaching out to us.</p>
    <p style="color:blue">OK, so it's more passive, rather than the team actively trying to integrate with these divisions. Ok. From a personal point of view, what do you find most interesting about IT as a whole?</p>
    <p>Oh, I think it’s definitely the problem solving. So, there’s maybe a business problem out there. And you know it doesn't have to be a technological solution, but you know you understand the detail. You go away and think about it. Because I'm in a technical role the solution will be through technology, and I can affect positive change through that.</p>
    <p style="color:blue">Yeah, excellent. So that sort of bridges on to my next question. What does IT mean for you and is there an example that captures that essence? So, problem solving? Problem solving is the essence of IT.</p>
    <p>Very much so. When you're in a support role, problem solving might equal troubleshooting, but it’s totally dynamic, you know, constantly changing technology, it’s constantly evolving it and it's quite exciting in that respect.</p>
    <p style="color:blue">Yeah, excellent. Alright well, I think that's probably all we've got time for. Thanks! Thanks so much for taking the time to talk to us! It was really helpful!</p>
